            // and they occur from top to bottom as you write inside the code.

<!-- Events in javascripts
    html events are things that happens to html pages.
    when js is used in html pages ,js react on these events.

    //HTML events
    An html event can be something the browser does ,or something the a user does

    //some examples of events
    web page finished its loading
    input field was changed
    html button clicked
    events happen do something


    //js lets you execute code when events are detected.
    //html allows event handler attributes ,with js code to be added to html elements

<!-- 
    4 ways of writing events in js
        1.using inline events alert();//rarely used
        2.By calling the function (most commonly used)
        3.By using inline events (based on id class or anything )
        4.using the event listners(addEventListner and IE's attachevent)


    <!-What is Event Object ?
    Event object is the parent object of the event object
    this is used to find out the details of the event occured
    simply it gives all the information related to the event happend recently
    example:
    mouseevents
    onclick
