What is difference between addeventlistner and onXXX events ? 
->Both are used to fire the event but the key difference is
when you write 2 or more function/code for same event then it gets override
means latest or last function get executed and earlier function never get used.

But by using the add event listner function you can handle such situations
where we need to add on more fucntion or action for that event.

note: addeventlistner is not work in internet explorer
